How edits are layered without mutating raw data\n   738\t\n   739\t### 7.1 Core principle: event sourcing with overlays\n   740\t\n   741\t* `system_state_events` and `raw_activity_events` define the **raw observed timeline**.\n   742\t* `user_edit_events` define a **layered “patch set”** that transforms the raw timeline into an “effective timeline”.\n   743\t* Raw tables are immutable by triggers. All user modifications are expressed as additional events.\n   744\t\n   745\t### 7.2 Effective timeline construction order (deterministic)\n   746\t\n   747\tGiven a requested report range `[R0, R1)`:\n   748\t\n   749\t1. **Compute base working intervals** from `system_state_events`.\n   750\t2. **Compute base attribution segments** from `raw_activity_events` intersected with working intervals.\n   751\t3. **Apply user edits** in this strict order:\n   752\t\n   753\t   1. Apply all `undo_edit` (filter out undone edits first, see below)\n   754\t   2. Apply all `delete_range` (subtract time)\n   755\t   3.

Implement the agent state machine first (lock/console/awake -> working), then emit `system_state_events`.\n  1307\t4. Add foreground app detection (`didActivateApplicationNotification`) and emit `raw_activity_events`.\n  1308\t5. Add Accessibility title capture with AXObserver + 1s poll fallback, including degraded mode without permission.\n  1309\t6.

Works on both Ubuntu and macOS runners.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Version 3 is currently in beta. Please report any issues you encounter. To use legacy version 2, use `@v2`.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n```\n\nAfter the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard [`run`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun) step:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n- name: Get swift version\n  run: swift --version # Swift 6.2\n```\n\nA specific Swift version can be set using the `swift-version` input:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: \"5.1\"\n- name: Get swift version\n  run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0\n```\n\nAlso works with snapshots:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: \"main-snapshot\"\n```\n\nWorks perfect together with matrixes:\n\n```yaml\nname: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }}\nruns-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\nstrategy:\n  matrix:\n    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]\n    swift: [\"5.4.3\", \"5.2.4\"]\nsteps:\n  - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n    with:\n      swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }}\n  - name: Get swift version\n    run: swift --version\n```\n\n### Skip GPG signature verification\n\nIf you are running on a runner that is not able to verify the GPG signature of the Swiftly package, you can skip the verification by setting the `skip-verify-signature` input to `true`.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    skip-verify-signature: true\n```\n\n### Caveats\n\nYAML interprets eg. `5.0` as a float, this action will then interpret that as `5` which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus:\n\n```\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: '5.0'\n```\n\nNot:\n\n```\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: 5.0\n```\n\n## Keeping the action up-to-date\n\nYou have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like `v3.0.0`) or use the major version tag (like `v3`).\n\n### Specific version\n\nWe recommend using the specific version tag together with [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates) to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot.\n\n### Major version tag\n\nIf you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.\n\n## Legal\n\nUses MIT license.\nThe Swift logo is a trademark of Apple Inc.\n",

Review `SPEC.md` in its entirety to understand the full context\n\n**Implementation scope** (implement ONLY these items):\n\n1. **SQLite schema** (from SPEC.md Section 6.4):\n   - Implement the exact DDL as specified for all tables: `identity`, `kv_metadata`, `applications`, `window_titles`, `tags`, `agent_runs`, `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, `user_edit_events`\n   - Implement all indexes exactly as specified\n   - Implement all immutability triggers exactly as specified (preventing UPDATE and DELETE on event tables)\n   - Do not modify, rename, or reinterpret any table names, column names, constraints, or data types\n\n2. **SQLite configuration** (from SPEC.md Section 6.1):\n   - Implement connection initialization with required PRAGMAs: `foreign_keys = ON`, `journal_mode = WAL`, `synchronous = NORMAL`, `busy_timeout = 5000`, `temp_store = MEMORY`\n\n3. **Schema versioning and migrations** (from SPEC.md Section 6.3):\n   - Implement schema versioning using `PRAGMA user_version`\n   - Implement forward-only migration system\n   - Create migration tracking table\n\n4. **Unit tests** (per SPEC.md Section 14.4 Testing Policy):\n   - Test that immutability triggers correctly prevent UPDATE operations on `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, and `user_edit_events`\n   - Test that immutability triggers correctly prevent DELETE operations on these same tables\n   - Test schema initialization from scratch\n   - Test schema migration paths\n   - Test PRAGMA configurations are applied correctly\n   - Test foreign key constraints are enforced\n   - All tests must pass before work is considered complete\n\n**Out of scope** (do NOT implement):\n- UI components (`WellWhaddyaKnowApp`)\n- Background agent (`wwkd` / `WellWhaddyaKnowAgent`)\n- XPC communication\n- Accessibility APIs or window title capture\n- CLI (`wwk` / `WellWhaddyaKnowCLI`)\n- App Store or Homebrew packaging\n- Timeline builder logic\n- Reporting queries\n- Sensor wrappers\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Follow the exact schema from SPEC.md Section 6.4 without deviation\n- The specification is frozen; do not rename, refactor, or reinterpret\n- Stop when storage layer and tests are complete\n- If any ambiguity exists in the specification, ask before proceeding rather than making assumptions\n\n**Module location** (per SPEC.md Section 11.1):\n- Place storage code in `Sources/Shared/Storage/`\n- Place tests in `Tests/Unit/`\n\n**Success criteria**:\n- All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n- All unit tests pass\n- Immutability guarantees are enforced and verified by tests\n- Schema versioning system is functional\n- No code beyond storage layer is implemented",

The project uses Swift and follows an event-sourcing architecture with immutable SQLite tables.\n\n**Git workflow**:\n- Create a new feature branch for this work\n- Commit incrementally as you see fit\n- You do not need approval to continue if tests are passing\n- Follow the git branching rules from `~/.augment/rules/00_base_rules.md`\n\n**Pre-implementation steps**:\n1. Review all `.md` rule files in `~/.augment/rules/`\n2. Review `SPEC.md` in its entirety to understand the full context\n\n**Implementation scope** (implement ONLY these items):\n\n1. **SQLite schema** (from SPEC.md Section 6.4):\n   - Implement the exact DDL as specified for all tables: `identity`, `kv_metadata`, `applications`, `window_titles`, `tags`, `agent_runs`, `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, `user_edit_events`\n   - Implement all indexes exactly as specified\n   - Implement all immutability triggers exactly as specified (preventing UPDATE and DELETE on event tables)\n   - Do not modify, rename, or reinterpret any table names, column names, constraints, or data types\n\n2. **SQLite configuration** (from SPEC.md Section 6.1):\n   - Implement connection initialization with required PRAGMAs: `foreign_keys = ON`, `journal_mode = WAL`, `synchronous = NORMAL`, `busy_timeout = 5000`, `temp_store = MEMORY`\n\n3. **Schema versioning and migrations** (from SPEC.md Section 6.3):\n   - Implement schema versioning using `PRAGMA user_version`\n   - Implement forward-only migration system\n   - Create migration tracking table\n\n4. **Unit tests** (per SPEC.md Section 14.4 Testing Policy):\n   - Test that immutability triggers correctly prevent UPDATE operations on `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, and `user_edit_events`\n   - Test that immutability triggers correctly prevent DELETE operations on these same tables\n   - Test schema initialization from scratch\n   - Test schema migration paths\n   - Test PRAGMA configurations are applied correctly\n   - Test foreign key constraints are enforced\n   - All tests must pass before work is considered complete\n\n**Out of scope** (do NOT implement):\n- UI components (`WellWhaddyaKnowApp`)\n- Background agent (`wwkd` / `WellWhaddyaKnowAgent`)\n- XPC communication\n- Accessibility APIs or window title capture\n- CLI (`wwk` / `WellWhaddyaKnowCLI`)\n- App Store or Homebrew packaging\n- Timeline builder logic\n- Reporting queries\n- Sensor wrappers\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Follow the exact schema from SPEC.md Section 6.4 without deviation\n- The specification is frozen; do not rename, refactor, or reinterpret\n- Stop when storage layer and tests are complete\n- If any ambiguity exists in the specification, ask before proceeding rather than making assumptions\n\n**Module location** (per SPEC.md Section 11.1):\n- Place storage code in `Sources/Shared/Storage/`\n- Place tests in `Tests/Unit/`\n\n**Success criteria**:\n- All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n- All unit tests pass\n- Immutability guarantees are enforced and verified by tests\n- Schema versioning system is functional\n- No code beyond storage layer is implemented"

How edits are layered without mutating raw data\n   738\t\n   739\t### 7.1 Core principle: event sourcing with overlays\n   740\t\n   741\t* `system_state_events` and `raw_activity_events` define the **raw observed timeline**.\n   742\t* `user_edit_events` define a **layered “patch set”** that transforms the raw timeline into an “effective timeline”.\n   743\t* Raw tables are immutable by triggers. All user modifications are expressed as additional events.\n   744\t\n   745\t### 7.2 Effective timeline construction order (deterministic)\n   746\t\n   747\tGiven a requested report range `[R0, R1)`:\n   748\t\n   749\t1. **Compute base working intervals** from `system_state_events`.\n   750\t2. **Compute base attribution segments** from `raw_activity_events` intersected with working intervals.\n   751\t3. **Apply user edits** in this strict order:\n   752\t\n   753\t   1. Apply all `undo_edit` (filter out undone edits first, see below)\n   754\t   2. Apply all `delete_range` (subtract time)\n   755\t   3. Apply all `add_range` (insert time, with precedence over base segments)\n   756\t   4.

              "summary_text": "# Conversation Summary\n\n## 1. Previous Conversation\n\nThe user requested implementation of the SQLite storage layer for a macOS time-tracking application called \"well-whaddya-know\". The project has a frozen specification in `SPEC.md` that uses Swift and follows an event-sourcing architecture with immutable SQLite tables. The user provided explicit implementation scope limited to:\n- SQLite schema DDL (exact implementation from SPEC.md Section 6.4)\n- SQLite connection configuration with required PRAGMAs (Section 6.1)\n- Schema versioning and migrations (Section 6.3)\n- Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality\n\nThe user explicitly stated what is OUT OF SCOPE: UI components, background agent, XPC communication, Accessibility APIs, CLI, packaging, timeline builder logic, reporting queries, and sensor wrappers.\n\n## 2. Current Work\n\nI was implementing the storage layer and unit tests for the well-whaddya-know project. The work progressed through these stages:\n\n1. Created a feature branch `feature/storage-layer`\n2. Created Swift Package structure with `Package.swift`\n3. Implemented the complete SQLite schema in `Sources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift` with all tables, indexes, and immutability triggers exactly as specified\n4. Implemented database connection management in `Sources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift` with required PRAGMA configurations\n5. Implemented schema versioning and migrations in `Sources/Shared/Storage/SchemaManager.swift`\n6. Created comprehensive unit tests but encountered an issue: XCTest is not available with just Command Line Tools (Xcode is not installed on the system)\n7. Converted tests from XCTest to Swift Testing framework (available in Swift 6.2 without Xcode)\n8. Successfully converted `StorageTests.swift` and `ImmutabilityTests.swift` to use Swift Testing\n9. Was in the process of converting `ForeignKeyTests.swift` when the summary was requested\n\nThe most recent action was completing the conversion of `ImmutabilityTests.swift` from XCTest to Swift Testing framework, replacing `XCTAssert*` calls with `#expect` and class-based tests with struct-based `@Suite` and `@Test` attributes.\n\n## 3. Key Technical Concepts\n\n- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**: Project structure using Package.swift\n- **Swift Testing Framework**: Modern testing framework (not XCTest) available in Swift 6.2+\n- **SQLite3**: Direct C API usage for database operations\n- **Event Sourcing Architecture**: Immutable append-only event tables\n- **PRAGMA Configuration**: SQLite settings per SPEC.md Section 6.1:\n  - `foreign_keys = ON`\n  - `journal_mode = WAL`\n  - `synchronous = NORMAL`\n  - `busy_timeout = 5000`\n  - `temp_store = MEMORY`\n- **Schema Versioning**: Using `PRAGMA user_version` for forward-only migrations\n- **Immutability Triggers**: BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers that RAISE(ABORT) on event tables\n- **In-memory databases**: Using `:memory:` for unit tests\n- **macOS 13+ (Ventura)**: Minimum platform requirement\n\n## 4. Relevant Files and Code\n\n### Package.swift\n- Created Swift Package with Storage library target and StorageTests test target\n- Platform: macOS 13+\n- Swift tools version: 5.9\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift\n- Contains exact DDL from SPEC.md Section 6.4\n- All table definitions: `identity`, `kv_metadata`, `applications`, `window_titles`, `tags`, `agent_runs`, `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, `user_edit_events`, `schema_migrations`\n- All indexes for event tables\n- Immutability triggers for three event tables:\n  - `trg_sse_no_update` and `trg_sse_no_delete` for `system_state_events`\n  - `trg_rae_no_update` and `trg_rae_no_delete` for `raw_activity_events`\n  - `trg_uee_no_update` and `trg_uee_no_delete` for `user_edit_events`\n- Helper properties: `allTableStatements`, `allIndexStatements`, `allTriggerStatements`, `allStatements`\n- Current schema version: 1\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift\n- Manages SQLite database connections\n- `open()` method applies all required PRAGMAs\n- `execute()` method for SQL execution\n- `getSchemaVersion()` and `setSchemaVersion()` for PRAGMA user_version\n- `getPragmaValue()` and `getPragmaIntValue()` for querying PRAGMA settings\n- `verifyPragmas()` returns dictionary of all PRAGMA settings\n- `rawPointer` property for advanced operations\n- Error handling via `DatabaseError` enum\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/SchemaManager.swift\n- Manages schema initialization and migrations\n- `initializeSchema()` handles both fresh databases and migrations\n- `Migration` struct for version, description, and SQL statements\n- Forward-only migration system\n- Records migrations in `schema_migrations` table\n- Version 1 migration includes all initial schema statements\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Storage.swift\n- Public API module file\n- Exports current schema version\n\n### Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift\n- Converted to Swift Testing framework\n- Uses `@Suite(\"Storage Tests\")` and `@Test` attributes\n- Tests schema initialization from scratch\n- Tests all tables are created\n- Tests schema initialization is idempotent\n- Tests all PRAGMA configurations (foreign_keys, journal_mode, synchronous, busy_timeout, temp_store)\n- Helper method `tableExists()` for verification\n\n### Tests/Unit/ImmutabilityTests.swift\n- Converted to Swift Testing framework\n- Uses `@Suite(\"Immutability Trigger Tests\")`\n- `setupConnection()` helper creates connection with schema and prerequisite data\n- Tests UPDATE rejection on all three event tables\n- Tests DELETE rejection on all three event tables\n- Tests INSERT still works on all three event tables\n- Uses `#expect(throws: DatabaseError.self)` for error assertions\n\n### Tests/Unit/ForeignKeyTests.swift\n- Still using XCTest (needs conversion)\n- Tests foreign key constraint enforcement\n- Tests invalid run_id, app_id, tag_id references\n- Tests nullable foreign keys work correctly\n\n## 5. Problem Solving\n\n**Problem**: XCTest not available without Xcode installation\n- System has Swift 6.2.3 with Command Line Tools only\n- Attempted `swift test` and `xcrun swift test` both failed with \"no such module 'XCTest'\"\n- Attempted `xcodebuild test` failed because Xcode is not installed\n\n**Solution**: Convert all tests to Swift Testing framework\n- Swift Testing is available in Swift 6.2+ without Xcode\n- Converted from class-based `XCTestCase` to struct-based `@Suite`\n- Converted from `func test*()` to `@Test(\"description\") func name()`\n- Converted from `XCTAssertEqual` to `#expect(a == b)`\n- Converted from `XCTAssertThrowsError` to `#expect(throws: ErrorType.self)`\n- Converted from `XCTAssertNoThrow` to direct `try` calls\n- Removed `setUp()`/`tearDown()` in favor of per-test setup with `defer { connection.close() }`\n\n**Status**: Two test files converted (StorageTests.swift, ImmutabilityTests.swift), one remaining (ForeignKeyTests.swift)\n\n## 6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Next Steps (from task list):\nThe task list shows task UUID `3cKhiEJyCRHx8Eo1hNK8nU` is IN_PROGRESS: \"Run all tests and verify passing\"\n\n**Remaining work**:\n\n1. **Convert ForeignKeyTests.swift to Swift Testing** - This file still uses XCTest and needs conversion following the same pattern as the other two test files:\n   - Change `import XCTest` to `import Testing`\n   - Change `final class ForeignKeyTests: XCTestCase` to `@Suite(\"Foreign Key Tests\") struct ForeignKeyTests`\n   - Remove `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods\n   - Convert all `func test*()` methods to `@Test(\"description\") func name()`\n   - Replace `XCTAssertThrowsError` with `#expect(throws: DatabaseError.self)`\n   - Replace `XCTAssertNoThrow` with direct `try` calls\n   - Add `let connection = DatabaseConnection(path: \":memory:\")` and setup at start of each test\n   - Add `defer { connection.close() }` to each test\n\n2. **Run the complete test suite** using `swift test` to verify all tests pass\n\n3. **Commit the storage layer implementation** to the feature branch with appropriate commit messages\n\n4. **Push the feature branch** to remote (per user's instruction: \"You do not need approval to continue if tests are passing\")\n\n5. **Verify success criteria from user's request**:\n   - ✅ All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n   - ⏳ All unit tests pass (pending test conversion completion)\n   - ✅ Immutability guarantees are enforced and verified by tests\n   - ✅ Schema versioning system is functional\n   - ✅ No code beyond storage layer is implemented\n\n**Direct quote from user's most recent explicit instruction**:\n> \"**Success criteria**:\n> - All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n> - All unit tests pass\n> - Immutability guarantees are enforced and verified by tests\n> - Schema versioning system is functional\n> - No code beyond storage layer is implemented\"\n\nThe work is nearly complete - only the ForeignKeyTests.swift conversion and final test run remain before the storage layer implementation can be considered done per the user's explicit scope.\n",

Review al... complete\n- If any ambiguity exists in the specification, ask before proceeding rather than making assumptions\n\n**Module location** (per SPEC.md Section 11.1):\n- Place storage code in `Sources/Shared/Storage/`\n- Place tests in `Tests/Unit/`\n\n**Success criteria**:\n- All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n- All unit tests pass\n- Immutability guarantees are enforced and verified by tests\n- Schema versioning system is functional\n- No code beyond storage layer is implemented\n</user>\n<agent_actions>\n\t<files_modified>\n\t\tSources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift\n\t\tSources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift\n\t\tTests/Unit/ImmutabilityTests.swift\n\t\tTests/Unit/StorageTests.swift\n\t</files_modified>\n\t<files_created>\n\t\tPackage.swift\n\t\tSources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift\n\t\tSources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift\n\t\tSources/Shared/Storage/SchemaManager.swift\n\t\tSources/Shared/Storage/Storage.swift\n\t\tTests/Unit/ForeignKeyTests.swift\n\t\tTests/Unit/ImmutabilityTests.swift\n\t\tTests/Unit/MigrationTests.swift\n\t\tTests/Unit/StorageTests.swift\n\t</files_created>\n\t<files_viewed>\n\t\t.\n\t\tPackage.swift\n\t\tSources/Shared\n\t\tSPEC.md\n\t\tTests/Unit\n\t</files_viewed>\n\t<terminal_commands>\n\t\tgit checkout -b feature/storage-layer\n\t\tls -la\n\t\tmkdir -p Sources/Shared/Storage\n\t\tswift build 2>&1\n\t</terminal_commands>\n</agent_actions>\n<agent_continues/>\n",

Previous Conversation\n\nThe user requested implementation of the SQLite storage layer for a macOS time-tracking application called \"well-whaddya-know\". The project has a frozen specification in `SPEC.md` that uses Swift and follows an event-sourcing architecture with immutable SQLite tables. The user provided explicit implementation scope limited to:\n- SQLite schema DDL (exact implementation from SPEC.md Section 6.4)\n- SQLite connection configuration with required PRAGMAs (Section 6.1)\n- Schema versioning and migrations (Section 6.3)\n- Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality\n\nThe user explicitly stated what is OUT OF SCOPE: UI components, background agent, XPC communication, Accessibility APIs, CLI, packaging, timeline builder logic, reporting queries, and sensor wrappers.\n\nThe user specified git workflow requirements:\n- Create a new feature branch for this work\n- Commit incrementally as appropriate\n- No approval needed to continue if tests are passing\n- Follow git branching rules from `~/.augment/rules/00_base_rules.md`\n\n## 2. Current Work\n\nI was implementing the storage layer and unit tests for the well-whaddya-know project. The work progressed through these stages:\n\n1. Created a feature branch `feature/storage-layer`\n2. Created Swift Package structure with `Package.swift`\n3. Implemented the complete SQLite schema in `Sources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift` with all tables, indexes, and immutability triggers exactly as specified\n4. Implemented database connection management in `Sources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift` with required PRAGMA configurations\n5. Implemented schema versioning and migrations in `Sources/Shared/Storage/SchemaManager.swift`\n6. Created comprehensive unit tests but encountered an issue: XCTest is not available with just Command Line Tools (Xcode is not installed on the system)\n7. Converted all tests from XCTest to Swift Testing framework (available in Swift 6.2 without Xcode)\n8. Updated `Package.swift` to include swift-testing dependency from GitHub\n9. Successfully ran tests - 33 out of 34 tests passed\n10. One test is failing: `testSchemaInitializationCreatesAllTables` - all 10 table existence checks are failing\n11. Modified the `tableExists` helper function to use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding\n12. Attempted to re-run tests but encountered terminal issues preventing command execution\n\n**Most recent action**: Modified the `tableExists` helper function in `Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift` to fix the table existence check, changing from using `sqlite3_bind_text` with parameters to direct string interpolation in the SQL query. Attempted to run tests again but terminal appears to be in a bad state (showing \"pipe heredoc>\" prompts).\n\n## 3. Key Technical Concepts\n\n- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**: Project structure using Package.swift\n- **Swift Testing Framework**: Modern testing framework (not XCTest) available in Swift 6.2+, using `@Suite`, `@Test`, and `#expect` syntax\n- **SQLite3**: Direct C API usage for database operations\n- **Event Sourcing Architecture**: Immutable append-only event tables\n- **PRAGMA Configuration**: SQLite settings per SPEC.md Section 6.1:\n  - `foreign_keys = ON`\n  - `journal_mode = WAL`\n  - `synchronous = NORMAL`\n  - `busy_timeout = 5000`\n  - `temp_store = MEMORY`\n- **Schema Versioning**: Using `PRAGMA user_version` for forward-only migrations\n- **Immutability Triggers**: BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers that RAISE(ABORT) on event tables\n- **In-memory databases**: Using `:memory:` for unit tests\n- **macOS 13+ (Ventura)**: Minimum platform requirement\n- **Swift 6.2.3**: Current Swift version with Command Line Tools only (no Xcode)\n\n## 4. Relevant Files and Code\n\n### Package.swift\n- Created Swift Package with Storage library target and StorageTests test target\n- Platform: macOS 13+\n- Swift tools version: 6.0 (updated from 5.9 to support Swift Testing)\n- Added dependency on `swift-testing` from GitHub main branch\n- Test target includes Testing product dependency\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git\", branch: \"main\"),\n],\ntargets: [\n    .testTarget(\n        name: \"StorageTests\",\n        dependencies: [\n            \"Storage\",\n            .product(name: \"Testing\", package: \"swift-testing\"),\n        ],\n        path: \"Tests/Unit\"\n    ),\n]\n```\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift\n- Contains exact DDL from SPEC.md Section 6.4\n- All table definitions: `identity`, `kv_metadata`, `applications`, `window_titles`, `tags`, `agent_runs`, `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, `user_edit_events`, `schema_migrations`\n- All indexes for event tables\n- Immutability triggers for three event tables:\n  - `trg_sse_no_update` and `trg_sse_no_delete` for `system_state_events`\n  - `trg_rae_no_update` and `trg_rae_no_delete` for `raw_activity_events`\n  - `trg_uee_no_update` and `trg_uee_no_delete` for `user_edit_events`\n- Helper properties: `allTableStatements`, `allIndexStatements`, `allTriggerStatements`, `allStatements`\n- Current schema version: 1\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift\n- Manages SQLite database connections\n- `open()` method applies all required PRAGMAs\n- `execute()` method for SQL execution using `sqlite3_exec`\n- `getSchemaVersion()` and `setSchemaVersion()` for PRAGMA user_version\n- `getPragmaValue()` and `getPragmaIntValue()` for querying PRAGMA settings\n- `verifyPragmas()` returns dictionary of all PRAGMA settings\n- `rawPointer` property for advanced operations\n- Error handling via `DatabaseError` enum\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/SchemaManager.swift\n- Manages schema initialization and migrations\n- `initializeSchema()` handles both fresh databases and migrations\n- `Migration` struct for version, description, and SQL statements\n- Forward-only migration system\n- Records migrations in `schema_migrations` table\n- Version 1 migration includes all initial schema statements\n- `applyInitialSchema()` executes all DDL statements and records migration\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Storage.swift\n- Public API module file\n- Exports current schema version\n\n### Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift\n- Converted to Swift Testing framework\n- Uses `@Suite(\"Storage Tests\")` and `@Test` attributes\n- Tests schema initialization from scratch\n- Tests all tables are created\n- Tests schema initialization is idempotent\n- Tests all PRAGMA configurations (foreign_keys, journal_mode, synchronous, busy_timeout, temp_store)\n- Helper method `tableExists()` for verification - **RECENTLY MODIFIED**:\n\n```swift\nprivate func tableExists(_ name: String, in connection: DatabaseConnection) throws -> Bool {\n    guard let db = connection.rawPointer else { return false }\n    \n    var statement: OpaquePointer?\n    defer { sqlite3_finalize(statement) }\n    \n    // Use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding for simplicity\n    let sql = \"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='\\(name)';\"\n    guard sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, sql, -1, &statement, nil) == SQLITE_OK else {\n        return false\n    }\n    \n    return sqlite3_step(statement) == SQLITE_ROW\n}\n```\n\n### Tests/Unit/ImmutabilityTests.swift\n- Converted to Swift Testing framework\n- Uses `@Suite(\"Immutability Trigger Tests\")`\n- `setupConnection()` helper creates connection with schema and prerequisite data\n- Tests UPDATE rejection on all three event tables\n- Tests DELETE rejection on all three event tables\n- Tests INSERT still works on all three event tables\n- Uses `#expect(throws: DatabaseError.self)` for error assertions\n\n### Tests/Unit/ForeignKeyTests.swift\n- Converted to Swift Testing framework\n- Uses `@Suite(\"Foreign Key Constraint Tests\")`\n- Tests foreign key constraint enforcement\n- Tests invalid run_id, app_id, tag_id references\n- Tests nullable foreign keys work correctly\n\n### Tests/Unit/MigrationTests.swift\n- Converted to Swift Testing framework\n- Uses `@Suite(\"Migration Tests\")`\n- Tests schema version management\n- Tests migration recording in schema_migrations table\n- Tests schema version mismatch detection\n- Tests multiple initializations are safe\n- Tests all DDL statements are valid SQL\n\n## 5. Problem Solving\n\n**Problem 1**: XCTest not available without Xcode installation\n- System has Swift 6.2.3 with Command Line Tools only\n- Attempted `swift test` and `xcrun swift test` both failed with \"no such module 'XCTest'\"\n- Attempted `xcodebuild test` failed because Xcode is not installed\n\n**Solution 1**: Convert all tests to Swift Testing framework\n- Swift Testing is available in Swift 6.2+ without Xcode\n- Converted from class-based `XCTestCase` to struct-based `@Suite`\n- Converted from `func test*()` to `@Test(\"description\") func name()`\n- Converted from `XCTAssertEqual` to `#expect(a == b)`\n- Converted from `XCTAssertThrowsError` to `#expect(throws: ErrorType.self)`\n- Converted from `XCTAssertNoThrow` to direct `try` calls\n- Removed `setUp()`/`tearDown()` in favor of per-test setup with `defer { connection.close() }`\n- Updated Package.swift to swift-tools-version 6.0 and added swift-testing dependency\n\n**Problem 2**: Swift Testing module not found\n- Initial conversion failed because Package.swift didn't include swift-testing dependency\n\n**Solution 2**: Added swift-testing as package dependency\n- Added dependency on `https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git` branch main\n- Added Testing product to test target dependencies\n- Successfully fetched and built swift-testing and its dependencies (swift-syntax)\n\n**Problem 3**: Test failure - `testSchemaInitializationCreatesAllTables` failing\n- All 10 table existence checks are failing\n- Test output shows: \"Expectation failed: try tableExists(tableName, in: connection)\" for all tables\n- However, the test \"All statements are valid SQL\" passes, which executes the same DDL statements\n- This suggests the tables ARE being created, but the `tableExists` helper is not detecting them\n\n**Attempted Solution 3**: Modified `tableExists` helper function\n- Changed from using `sqlite3_bind_text` with parameter binding to direct string interpolation\n- Original code used: `sqlite3_bind_text(statement, 1, name, -1, nil)`\n- New code uses: `let sql = \"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='\\(name)';\"`\n- This change was made to eliminate potential issues with parameter binding\n\n**Problem 4**: Terminal in bad state\n- After making the fix to `tableExists`, attempted to re-run tests\n- Terminal appears to be stuck in heredoc mode (showing \"pipe heredoc>\" prompts)\n- Multiple attempts to run commands result in \"pipe heredoc>\" output\n- Unable to verify if the fix to `tableExists` resolved the test failure\n\n## 6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps\n\n### Immediate Next Steps\n\n**Task 1: Resolve terminal issue and re-run tests**\n- The terminal appears to be in a bad state, preventing test execution\n- Need to successfully run `swift test` to verify if the `tableExists` fix resolved the failing test\n- Current test status: 33/34 tests passing, 1 test failing with 10 issues\n\n**Task 2: Fix the failing test if still failing**\n- If `testSchemaInitializationCreatesAllTables` still fails after the `tableExists` fix, need to debug further\n- The issue is that all 10 table existence checks are returning false\n- Possible debugging approaches:\n  - Add debug logging to see what `sqlite3_prepare_v2` and `sqlite3_step` return\n  - Verify the database connection is valid when `tableExists` is called\n  - Check if tables are actually being created by the schema initialization\n  - Consider using `connection.execute()` with a SELECT query instead of raw SQLite3 API\n\n**Task 3: Commit and push the storage layer implementation**\n- Once all tests pass, commit the implementation to the feature branch\n- User stated: \"You do not need approval to continue if tests are passing\"\n- Commit message should describe the storage layer implementation\n\n**Task 4: Verify success criteria**\nFrom the user's original request:\n> **Success criteria**:\n> - All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n> - All unit tests pass\n> - Immutability guarantees are enforced and verified by tests\n> - Schema versioning system is functional\n> - No code beyond storage layer is implemented\n\nCurrent status:\n- ✅ All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n- ⏳ All unit tests pass (33/34 passing, 1 failing - needs verification after terminal fix)\n- ✅ Immutability guarantees are enforced and verified by tests (all immutability tests passing)\n- ✅ Schema versioning system is functional (all migration tests passing)\n- ✅ No code beyond storage layer is implemented\n\n**Direct quote from most recent work**:\nThe most recent action before the terminal issue was modifying the `tableExists` helper function in `Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift`. The test failure output showed:\n```\n✘ Test \"Schema initialization creates all tables\" recorded an issue at StorageTests.swift:59:13: Expectation failed: try tableExists(tableName, in: connection)\n↳ Table 'identity' should exist\n```\nThis was repeated for all 10 tables. The fix applied was changing the SQL query construction from parameter binding to string interpolation, but verification of this fix is blocked by the terminal issue.\n",

This is blocking my ability to run `swift test` to verify the fix I made to the `tableExists` helper function.\n\n**Could you please run this command in your terminal and share the output?**\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/jmajor/projects/daylily/well-whaddya-know && swift test\n```\n\n**Background on the fix I made:**\nI modified `Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift` to fix the `tableExists` helper function. The original version used `sqlite3_bind_text` for parameter binding, which may have been causing issues. The new version uses direct string interpolation in the SQL query:\n\n````swift path=Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift mode=EXCERPT\nprivate func tableExists(_ name: String, in connection: DatabaseConnection) throws -> Bool {\n    guard let db = connection.rawPointer else { return false }\n    var statement: OpaquePointer?\n    defer { sqlite3_finalize(statement) }\n    // Use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding for simplicity\n    let sql = \"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='\\(name)';\"\n    ...\n}\n````\n\nOnce I can verify the tests pass (33/34 were passing before, the fix should address the 1 failing test), I'll commit and push the storage layer implementation.\n\n**Do this next**\n1. Run `swift test` in the terminal and share the output with me\n2. If all 34 tests pass, I'll proceed to commit the changes to the feature branch\n3. If the test still fails, I'll debug further based on the output\n",

              "summary_text": "# Conversation Summary\n\n## 1. Previous Conversation\n\nThe user requested implementation of the SQLite storage layer for a macOS time-tracking application called \"well-whaddya-know\". The project has a frozen specification in `SPEC.md` that uses Swift and follows an event-sourcing architecture with immutable SQLite tables. The user provided explicit implementation scope limited to:\n- SQLite schema DDL (exact implementation from SPEC.md Section 6.4)\n- SQLite connection configuration with required PRAGMAs (Section 6.1)\n- Schema versioning and migrations (Section 6.3)\n- Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality\n\nThe user explicitly stated what is OUT OF SCOPE: UI components, background agent, XPC communication, Accessibility APIs, CLI, packaging, timeline builder logic, reporting queries, and sensor wrappers.\n\nThe user specified git workflow requirements:\n- Create a new feature branch for this work\n- Commit incrementally as appropriate\n- No approval needed to continue if tests are passing\n- Follow git branching rules from `~/.augment/rules/00_base_rules.md`\n\n## 2. Current Work\n\nI successfully implemented the complete SQLite storage layer and all tests passed locally (34/34 tests). The implementation was committed and pushed to the `feature/storage-layer` branch, and a pull request was created (PR #1). However, the GitHub Actions CI failed because it was using Swift 6.0 while the `swift-testing` library from the main branch requires Swift 6.2.\n\nThe user then informed me that the terminal issues were caused by the VS Code Swift extension and requested that I:\n1. Add basic CI tests\n2. Commit and push to the feature branch\n3. Create the PR\n\nI added a GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) that initially used Swift 6.0, which caused build failures. I then updated the CI to use Swift 6.2 to match the local development environment and the requirements of swift-testing. The most recent commit was:\n\n```\n[feature/storage-layer 26b9c9b] Fix CI: Use Swift 6.2 to match swift-testing requirements\n```\n\nThe work is currently at the point where the CI fix has been committed locally but not yet pushed to the remote branch.\n\n## 3. Key Technical Concepts\n\n- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**: Project structure using Package.swift\n- **Swift Testing Framework**: Modern testing framework (not XCTest) available in Swift 6.2+, using `@Suite`, `@Test`, and `#expect` syntax\n- **SQLite3**: Direct C API usage for database operations\n- **Event Sourcing Architecture**: Immutable append-only event tables\n- **PRAGMA Configuration**: SQLite settings per SPEC.md Section 6.1:\n  - `foreign_keys = ON`\n  - `journal_mode = WAL`\n  - `synchronous = NORMAL`\n  - `busy_timeout = 5000`\n  - `temp_store = MEMORY`\n- **Schema Versioning**: Using `PRAGMA user_version` for forward-only migrations\n- **Immutability Triggers**: BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers that RAISE(ABORT) on event tables\n- **In-memory databases**: Using `:memory:` for unit tests\n- **macOS 13+ (Ventura)**: Minimum platform requirement\n- **Swift 6.2.3**: Current Swift version with Command Line Tools only (no Xcode)\n- **GitHub Actions CI**: Using macos-14 runners with Swift 6.2\n\n## 4. Relevant Files and Code\n\n### Package.swift\n- Created Swift Package with Storage library target and StorageTests test target\n- Platform: macOS 13+\n- Swift tools version: 6.0\n- Dependency on `swift-testing` from GitHub main branch (requires Swift 6.2)\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git\", branch: \"main\"),\n],\n```\n\n### .github/workflows/ci.yaml\n- GitHub Actions workflow for CI\n- Runs on push to main/feature/* branches and PRs to main\n- Two jobs: `test` (Swift build and test) and `lint` (Swift format check)\n- Uses Swift 6.2 (updated from 6.0 to fix compatibility with swift-testing)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup Swift\n  uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2\n  with:\n    swift-version: \"6.0\"  # This was the issue - needs to be 6.2 or higher\n```\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift\n- Contains exact DDL from SPEC.md Section 6.4\n- All 10 tables: `identity`, `kv_metadata`, `applications`, `window_titles`, `tags`, `agent_runs`, `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, `user_edit_events`, `schema_migrations`\n- All indexes for event tables\n- Immutability triggers (BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE) for event tables\n- Helper properties: `allTableStatements`, `allIndexStatements`, `allTriggerStatements`, `allStatements`\n- Current schema version: 1\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift\n- Manages SQLite database connections\n- `open()` method applies all required PRAGMAs\n- `execute()` method for SQL execution using `sqlite3_exec`\n- `getSchemaVersion()` and `setSchemaVersion()` for PRAGMA user_version\n- `getPragmaValue()` and `getPragmaIntValue()` for querying PRAGMA settings\n- `verifyPragmas()` returns dictionary of all PRAGMA settings\n- `rawPointer` property for advanced operations\n- Error handling via `DatabaseError` enum\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/SchemaManager.swift\n- Manages schema initialization and migrations\n- `initializeSchema()` handles both fresh databases and migrations\n- `Migration` struct for version, description, and SQL statements\n- Forward-only migration system\n- Records migrations in `schema_migrations` table\n- Version 1 migration includes all initial schema statements\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Storage.swift\n- Public API module file\n- Exports current schema version\n\n### Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift\n- Converted to Swift Testing framework\n- Uses `@Suite(\"Storage Tests\")` and `@Test` attributes\n- Tests schema initialization, PRAGMA verification, table creation\n- Helper method `tableExists()` - fixed to use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding\n\n```swift\nprivate func tableExists(_ name: String, in connection: DatabaseConnection) throws -> Bool {\n    guard let db = connection.rawPointer else { return false }\n    var statement: OpaquePointer?\n    defer { sqlite3_finalize(statement) }\n    // Use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding for simplicity\n    let sql = \"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='\\(name)';\"\n    guard sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, sql, -1, &statement, nil) == SQLITE_OK else {\n        return false\n    }\n    return sqlite3_step(statement) == SQLITE_ROW\n}\n```\n\n### Tests/Unit/ImmutabilityTests.swift\n- Tests UPDATE/DELETE rejection on all three event tables\n- Tests INSERT still works on all three event tables\n- Uses `#expect(throws: DatabaseError.self)` for error assertions\n\n### Tests/Unit/ForeignKeyTests.swift\n- Tests foreign key constraint enforcement\n- Tests invalid run_id, app_id, tag_id references\n- Tests nullable foreign keys work correctly\n\n### Tests/Unit/MigrationTests.swift\n- Tests schema version management\n- Tests migration recording in schema_migrations table\n- Tests schema version mismatch detection\n- Tests multiple initializations are safe\n\n## 5. Problem Solving\n\n**Problem 1**: XCTest not available without Xcode installation\n- System has Swift 6.2.3 with Command Line Tools only\n- **Solution**: Converted all tests to Swift Testing framework, which is available in Swift 6.2+ without Xcode\n\n**Problem 2**: Swift Testing module not found\n- **Solution**: Added swift-testing as package dependency from GitHub main branch\n\n**Problem 3**: Test failure - `testSchemaInitializationCreatesAllTables` failing\n- All 10 table existence checks were failing\n- **Solution**: Modified `tableExists` helper function to use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding\n- All 34 tests now pass locally\n\n**Problem 4**: Terminal issues preventing test execution\n- Terminal was stuck in heredoc mode from previous commands\n- **Solution**: User identified this was caused by VS Code Swift extension installation\n\n**Problem 5**: GitHub Actions CI failing with Swift 6.0\n- Error: `'swift-testing': package 'swift-testing' is using Swift tools version 6.2.0 but the installed version is 6.0.3`\n- The swift-testing library from main branch requires Swift 6.2+\n- **Solution**: Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to use Swift 6.2 instead of 6.0\n\n## 6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps\n\n### Task 1: Push CI fix and verify tests pass in CI\nThe CI configuration has been fixed locally but needs to be pushed to trigger a new CI run. The most recent commit message was:\n```\n[feature/storage-layer 26b9c9b] Fix CI: Use Swift 6.2 to match swift-testing requirements\n```\n\n**Next steps**:\n1. Push the commit to the remote feature branch\n2. Wait for CI to complete and verify all tests pass\n3. Update the PR if needed\n\n### Task 2: Complete the PR workflow\nFrom the user's request: \"Can you add some basic CI tests as well, then when done, commit and push to to this branch and make the PR\"\n\nThe PR has already been created (PR #1: https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/well-whaddya-know/pull/1), but the CI fix needs to be pushed to make the tests pass.\n\n**Success criteria** (all met except CI passing):\n- ✅ All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n- ⏳ All unit tests pass (34/34 passing locally, CI needs to pass)\n- ✅ Immutability guarantees enforced and verified by tests\n- ✅ Schema versioning system is functional\n- ✅ No code beyond storage layer implemented\n- ✅ CI workflow added\n\n**Direct quote from most recent work**:\nThe user said: \"Can you add some basic CI tests as well, then when done, commit and push to to this branch and make the PR\"\n\nI have added the CI workflow, committed the fix for Swift 6.2 compatibility, but have not yet pushed this final commit to the remote branch.\n",

This is blocking my ability to run `swift test` to verify the fix I made to the `tableExists` helper function.\n\n**Could you please run this command in your terminal and share the output?**\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/jmajor/projects/daylily/well-whaddya-know && swift test\n```\n\n**Background on the fix I made:**\nI modified `Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift` to fix the `tableExists` helper function. The original version used `sqlite3_bind_text` for parameter binding, which may have been causing issues. The new version uses direct string interpolation in the SQL query:\n\n````swift path=Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift mode=EXCERPT\nprivate func tableExists(_ name: String, in connection: DatabaseConnection) throws -> Bool {\n    guard let db = connection.rawPointer else { return false }\n    var statement: OpaquePointer?\n    defer { sqlite3_finalize(statement) }\n    // Use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding for simplicity\n    let sql = \"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='\\(name)';\"\n    ...\n}\n````\n\nOnce I can verify the tests pass (33/34 were passing before, the fix should address the 1 failing test), I'll commit and push the storage layer implementation.\n\n**Do this next**\n1. Run `swift test` in the terminal and share the output with me\n2. If all 34 tests pass, I'll proceed to commit the changes to the feature branch\n3. If the test still fails, I'll debug further based on the output\n\n</agent_response>\n\n<user>\nyou are empowered to run all of the tests to keep proceeding.

Works on both Ubuntu and macOS runners.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Version 3 is currently in beta. Please report any issues you encounter. To use legacy version 2, use `@v2`.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the action with the latest swift version available, simply add the action as a step in your workflow:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n```\n\nAfter the environment is configured you can run swift commands using the standard [`run`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun) step:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n- name: Get swift version\n  run: swift --version # Swift 6.2\n```\n\nA specific Swift version can be set using the `swift-version` input:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: \"5.1\"\n- name: Get swift version\n  run: swift --version # Swift 5.1.0\n```\n\nAlso works with snapshots:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: \"main-snapshot\"\n```\n\nWorks perfect together with matrixes:\n\n```yaml\nname: Swift ${{ matrix.swift }} on ${{ matrix.os }}\nruns-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\nstrategy:\n  matrix:\n    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]\n    swift: [\"5.4.3\", \"5.2.4\"]\nsteps:\n  - uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n    with:\n      swift-version: ${{ matrix.swift }}\n  - name: Get swift version\n    run: swift --version\n```\n\n### Skip GPG signature verification\n\nIf you are running on a runner that is not able to verify the GPG signature of the Swiftly package, you can skip the verification by setting the `skip-verify-signature` input to `true`.\n\n```yaml\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    skip-verify-signature: true\n```\n\n### Caveats\n\nYAML interprets eg. `5.0` as a float, this action will then interpret that as `5` which will result in eg. Swift 5.5 being resolved. Quote your inputs! Thus:\n\n```\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: '5.0'\n```\n\nNot:\n\n```\n- uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v3\n  with:\n    swift-version: 5.0\n```\n\n## Keeping the action up-to-date\n\nYou have two options for keeping this action up-to-date: either you define a specific version (like `v3.0.0`) or use the major version tag (like `v3`).\n\n### Specific version\n\nWe recommend using the specific version tag together with [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates) to keep the action up-to-date. That way you will automatically get notifed when the action updates and you can read the changelog directly in the PR opened by dependabot.\n\n### Major version tag\n\nIf you don't plan on keeping tabs on updates or don't want to use Dependabot but still would like to always use the latest version, you can use the main version tag.\n\n## Legal\n\nUses MIT license.\nThe Swift logo is a trademark of Apple Inc.\n",

              "summary_text": "# Conversation Summary\n\n## 1. Previous Conversation\n\nThe user requested implementation of the SQLite storage layer for a macOS time-tracking application called \"well-whaddya-know\". The project has a frozen specification in `SPEC.md` that uses Swift and follows an event-sourcing architecture with immutable SQLite tables. The user provided explicit implementation scope limited to:\n- SQLite schema DDL (exact implementation from SPEC.md Section 6.4)\n- SQLite connection configuration with required PRAGMAs (Section 6.1)\n- Schema versioning and migrations (Section 6.3)\n- Comprehensive unit tests for all functionality\n\nThe user explicitly stated what is OUT OF SCOPE: UI components, background agent, XPC communication, Accessibility APIs, CLI, packaging, timeline builder logic, reporting queries, and sensor wrappers.\n\nThe user specified git workflow requirements:\n- Create a new feature branch for this work\n- Commit incrementally as appropriate\n- No approval needed to continue if tests are passing\n- Follow git branching rules from `~/.augment/rules/00_base_rules.md`\n\nI successfully implemented the complete SQLite storage layer and all tests passed locally (34/34 tests). The implementation was committed and pushed to the `feature/storage-layer` branch, and a pull request was created (PR #1).\n\n## 2. Current Work\n\nAfter the initial implementation was pushed, the user requested that I add basic CI tests, commit, push to the feature branch, and create a PR. I added a GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) that initially used Swift 6.0, which caused build failures because the `swift-testing` library from the main branch requires Swift 6.2+.\n\nI then updated the CI to use Swift 6.2 to match the local development environment and the requirements of swift-testing from the main branch. The commit was made:\n```\n[feature/storage-layer 26b9c9b] Fix CI: Use Swift 6.2 to match swift-testing requirements\n```\n\nThis commit was pushed to the remote feature branch. However, when checking the CI status, I discovered that the CI runs were failing with `conclusion: failure`. The \"Swift Format Check\" job passed, but the \"Swift Tests\" job failed with exit code 1.\n\nUpon investigation, I realized the issue: the `swift-testing` package from the main branch requires Swift 6.2+, but GitHub Actions runners may not have Swift 6.2 readily available or there may be compatibility issues.\n\nI attempted to resolve this by:\n1. First trying to remove the swift-testing dependency entirely (assuming Swift 6.0+ includes Testing natively) - this failed because the Testing module is not available in the open-source Swift toolchain without the package dependency\n2. Then updating Package.swift to use a specific version of swift-testing (6.0.0) that is compatible with Swift 6.0, and reverting the CI workflow back to Swift 6.0\n\nThe most recent changes made:\n- Updated `Package.swift` to use `swift-testing` version 6.0.0 exactly: `.package(url: \"https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git\", exact: \"6.0.0\")`\n- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to use Swift 6.0 instead of 6.2\n\nThese changes have been made locally but NOT yet tested or committed.\n\n## 3. Key Technical Concepts\n\n- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**: Project structure using Package.swift\n- **Swift Testing Framework**: Modern testing framework (not XCTest) using `@Suite`, `@Test`, and `#expect` syntax\n  - Version 6.0.0 is compatible with Swift 6.0\n  - The main branch requires Swift 6.2+\n  - Not included in open-source Swift toolchain by default, requires package dependency\n- **SQLite3**: Direct C API usage for database operations\n- **Event Sourcing Architecture**: Immutable append-only event tables\n- **PRAGMA Configuration**: SQLite settings per SPEC.md Section 6.1:\n  - `foreign_keys = ON`\n  - `journal_mode = WAL`\n  - `synchronous = NORMAL`\n  - `busy_timeout = 5000`\n  - `temp_store = MEMORY`\n- **Schema Versioning**: Using `PRAGMA user_version` for forward-only migrations\n- **Immutability Triggers**: BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE triggers that RAISE(ABORT) on event tables\n- **In-memory databases**: Using `:memory:` for unit tests\n- **macOS 13+ (Ventura)**: Minimum platform requirement\n- **Swift 6.0**: Swift tools version for the package\n- **Swift 6.2.3**: Local development Swift version with Command Line Tools only (no Xcode)\n- **GitHub Actions CI**: Using macos-14 runners, now configured for Swift 6.0\n\n## 4. Relevant Files and Code\n\n### Package.swift\n- Swift Package with Storage library target and StorageTests test target\n- Platform: macOS 13+\n- Swift tools version: 6.0\n- **Most recent change**: Updated to use swift-testing version 6.0.0 exactly (compatible with Swift 6.0)\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    // Swift Testing 6.0.0 is compatible with Swift 6.0\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git\", exact: \"6.0.0\"),\n],\n```\n\n### .github/workflows/ci.yaml\n- GitHub Actions workflow for CI\n- Runs on push to main/feature/* branches and PRs to main\n- Two jobs: `test` (Swift build and test) and `lint` (Swift format check)\n- **Most recent change**: Reverted to use Swift 6.0 (from 6.2) to match swift-testing 6.0.0 compatibility\n\n```yaml\n- name: Setup Swift\n  uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v2\n  with:\n    swift-version: \"6.0\"\n```\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Schema.swift\n- Contains exact DDL from SPEC.md Section 6.4\n- All 10 tables: `identity`, `kv_metadata`, `applications`, `window_titles`, `tags`, `agent_runs`, `system_state_events`, `raw_activity_events`, `user_edit_events`, `schema_migrations`\n- All indexes for event tables\n- Immutability triggers (BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE) for event tables\n- Helper properties: `allTableStatements`, `allIndexStatements`, `allTriggerStatements`, `allStatements`\n- Current schema version: 1\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/DatabaseConnection.swift\n- Manages SQLite database connections\n- `open()` method applies all required PRAGMAs\n- `execute()` method for SQL execution using `sqlite3_exec`\n- `getSchemaVersion()` and `setSchemaVersion()` for PRAGMA user_version\n- `getPragmaValue()` and `getPragmaIntValue()` for querying PRAGMA settings\n- `verifyPragmas()` returns dictionary of all PRAGMA settings\n- `rawPointer` property for advanced operations\n- Error handling via `DatabaseError` enum\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/SchemaManager.swift\n- Manages schema initialization and migrations\n- `initializeSchema()` handles both fresh databases and migrations\n- `Migration` struct for version, description, and SQL statements\n- Forward-only migration system\n- Records migrations in `schema_migrations` table\n- Version 1 migration includes all initial schema statements\n\n### Sources/Shared/Storage/Storage.swift\n- Public API module file\n- Exports current schema version\n\n### Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift\n- Uses Swift Testing framework with `@Suite(\"Storage Tests\")` and `@Test` attributes\n- Tests schema initialization, PRAGMA verification, table creation\n- Helper method `tableExists()` uses direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding\n\n```swift\nprivate func tableExists(_ name: String, in connection: DatabaseConnection) throws -> Bool {\n    guard let db = connection.rawPointer else { return false }\n    var statement: OpaquePointer?\n    defer { sqlite3_finalize(statement) }\n    let sql = \"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='\\(name)';\"\n    guard sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, sql, -1, &statement, nil) == SQLITE_OK else {\n        return false\n    }\n    return sqlite3_step(statement) == SQLITE_ROW\n}\n```\n\n### Tests/Unit/ImmutabilityTests.swift\n- Tests UPDATE/DELETE rejection on all three event tables\n- Tests INSERT still works on all three event tables\n- Uses `#expect(throws: DatabaseError.self)` for error assertions\n\n### Tests/Unit/ForeignKeyTests.swift\n- Tests foreign key constraint enforcement\n- Tests invalid run_id, app_id, tag_id references\n- Tests nullable foreign keys work correctly\n\n### Tests/Unit/MigrationTests.swift\n- Tests schema version management\n- Tests migration recording in schema_migrations table\n- Tests schema version mismatch detection\n- Tests multiple initializations are safe\n\n## 5. Problem Solving\n\n**Problem 1**: XCTest not available without Xcode installation\n- System has Swift 6.2.3 with Command Line Tools only\n- **Solution**: Converted all tests to Swift Testing framework\n\n**Problem 2**: Swift Testing module not found initially\n- **Solution**: Added swift-testing as package dependency from GitHub main branch\n\n**Problem 3**: Test failure - `testSchemaInitializationCreatesAllTables` failing\n- All 10 table existence checks were failing\n- **Solution**: Modified `tableExists` helper function to use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding\n- All 34 tests now pass locally\n\n**Problem 4**: Terminal issues preventing test execution\n- Terminal was stuck in heredoc mode from previous commands\n- **Solution**: User identified this was caused by VS Code Swift extension installation\n\n**Problem 5**: GitHub Actions CI failing with Swift 6.0 and swift-testing from main branch\n- Error: `'swift-testing': package 'swift-testing' is using Swift tools version 6.2.0 but the installed version is 6.0.3`\n- The swift-testing library from main branch requires Swift 6.2+\n- **First attempted solution**: Updated CI to use Swift 6.2 - this was committed and pushed but CI still failed\n- **Second attempted solution**: Tried to remove swift-testing dependency entirely, assuming Swift 6.0+ includes Testing natively - this failed because Testing module is not available in open-source Swift toolchain without the package\n- **Current solution being implemented**: Use swift-testing version 6.0.0 exactly (which is compatible with Swift 6.0) and revert CI to Swift 6.0\n\n## 6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps\n\n### Task 1: Test and commit the swift-testing 6.0.0 fix\n\n**Status**: Changes made to Package.swift and .github/workflows/ci.yaml but not yet tested locally or committed.\n\n**Direct quote from work context**: The user said: \"Can you add some basic CI tests as well, then when done, commit and push to to this branch and make the PR\"\n\n**Changes made**:\n- Updated `Package.swift` to use `.package(url: \"https://github.com/apple/swift-testing.git\", exact: \"6.0.0\")`\n- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` to use `swift-version: \"6.0\"` (reverted from 6.2)\n\n**Next steps**:\n1. Clean build and test locally with the new swift-testing 6.0.0 dependency: `rm -rf .build Package.resolved && swift test`\n2. Verify all 34 tests pass\n3. Commit the changes with message describing the fix\n4. Push to the feature/storage-layer branch\n5. Wait for CI to complete and verify all tests pass in GitHub Actions\n6. Confirm PR #1 shows passing CI checks\n\n**Success criteria**:\n- ✅ All tables, indexes, and triggers created exactly as specified\n- ⏳ All unit tests pass (34/34 passing locally, CI needs to pass)\n- ✅ Immutability guarantees enforced and verified by tests\n- ✅ Schema versioning system is functional\n- ✅ No code beyond storage layer implemented\n- ⏳ CI workflow added and passing\n",

This is blocking my ability to run `swift test` to verify the fix I made to the `tableExists` helper function.\n\n**Could you please run this command in your terminal and share the output?**\n\n```bash\ncd /Users/jmajor/projects/daylily/well-whaddya-know && swift test\n```\n\n**Background on the fix I made:**\nI modified `Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift` to fix the `tableExists` helper function. The original version used `sqlite3_bind_text` for parameter binding, which may have been causing issues. The new version uses direct string interpolation in the SQL query:\n\n````swift path=Tests/Unit/StorageTests.swift mode=EXCERPT\nprivate func tableExists(_ name: String, in connection: DatabaseConnection) throws -> Bool {\n    guard let db = connection.rawPointer else { return false }\n    var statement: OpaquePointer?\n    defer { sqlite3_finalize(statement) }\n    // Use direct string interpolation instead of parameter binding for simplicity\n    let sql = \"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='\\(name)';\"\n    ...\n}\n````\n\nOnce I can verify the tests pass (33/34 were passing before, the fix should address the 1 failing test), I'll commit and push the storage layer implementation.\n\n**Do this next**\n1. Run `swift test` in the terminal and share the output with me\n2. If all 34 tests pass, I'll proceed to commit the changes to the feature branch\n3. If the test still fails, I'll debug further based on the output\n\n</agent_response>\n\n<user>\nyou are empowered to run all of the tests to keep proceeding.
